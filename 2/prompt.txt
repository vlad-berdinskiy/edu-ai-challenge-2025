You are a QA engineer helping to improve bug reports. Convert the following informal bug note into a properly structured ticket using the format below. Fill in any missing details with reasonable assumptions if necessary.

Input Example:
“Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”

Output Format:
Title: [Concise, specific issue summary]
Description: [Brief explanation of the problem]
Steps to Reproduce: [Step-by-step instructions to trigger the bug]
Expected Behavior: [What should happen]
Actual Behavior: [What actually happens]
Environment: [OS, Browser, Device, App Version – if unknown, state ‘Not specified’]
Severity/Impact: [Low/Medium/High/Critical – justify if unclear]

Rules:
Keep titles under 10 words.

Assume Steps to Reproduce start from the app’s homepage unless noted.

If environment details are missing, infer common defaults (e.g., latest Safari on macOS).

For severity, default to ‘Medium’ if impact is unclear but functionality is broken.

Now, process this bug note:
‘Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond’
